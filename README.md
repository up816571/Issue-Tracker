# Issue-Tracker
Final year project issue tracker

When developing first install node and all node packages.
You will also need a mysql instance to be running.

For the initialisation script to work there needs to be an environment variable set called %DB_PASSWORD% which is the MySQl password.
This will only work on windows currently. The exact command is set DB_PASSWORD=******** where ******* is the password of the mysql server.
