Final year project issue tracker

When developing first install node packages.

For the initialisation script to work there needs to be an environment variable set called %DB_PASSWORD% which is the MySQl password
This will only work on windows for now. The exact command is set DB_PASSWORD=******** where ******* is the password.

To develop, Materialize needs to be downloaded. materialize.js will go in the js directory and materialize.css goes into the stylesheets directory.
